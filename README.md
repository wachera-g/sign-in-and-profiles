# sign-in-and-profiles
A tiny backend that lets people register, log in, view their profile, and log out - built to learn and teach on secure authentication.


What this is: a tiny backend for Register, Log in, View my profile, Log out.

What you’ll learn: safe password storage, sessions/tokens, clear errors, testing with simple tools.

Current status: We’re setting up structure and docs before building.

How to follow along: check the docs/ folder (api-overview + test plan); new features will land in small, well-named commits.

Start the app from VS Code’s NPM SCRIPTS panel → dev (or npm run dev in the VS Code terminal after temporarily allowing scripts).

Visit http://localhost:3000/health → you should see { "ok": true }.

Go to Source Control → commit:
docs: add local run instructions for /health

Push.
