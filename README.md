# sign-in-and-profiles
A tiny backend that lets people register, log in, view their profile, and log out - built to learn and teach on secure authentication.


What this is: a tiny backend for Register, Log in, View my profile, Log out.

What you’ll learn: safe password storage, sessions/tokens, clear errors, testing with simple tools.

Current status: We’re setting up structure and docs before building.

How to follow along: check the docs/ folder (api-overview + test plan); new features will land in small, well-named commits.
